# reading-list
A list of books I have read or intend on reading, along with my thoughts.

# Inspiration

I got the inspiration to make a reading list from seeing [Brandon Amos's](https://github.com/bamos) reading list, although I am going to try and make my own, as you don't learn by copying, but the idea is inspired by his project.

# Future Plans

Going to impliment more functionality, such as deleting books, adding thoughts, edits, and adding a database

Also make it look fancier with css
